## Challenge

Your challenge is to create a memory pairs game that has players find pairs of cards. At the very least you should:

* Come up with a list of pairs.
* Show a grid of face-down cards.
* Let the player select any two cards, and show them face up as they are tapped.
* If they match remove them; if they donâ€™t match, wait a second then turn them face down again.
* Show a You Win message once all are matched.
